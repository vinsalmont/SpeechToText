# MVVM

This project is based on the MVVM (Model-View-View-Model) architecture that could be represented by this chart.

## Model

The Model layer is responsivle for respresenting the data from your business logic and decode a JSON response from the server.

## View

The View layer is responsible for handling all the layout related code, such as displaying the data and ask for the data.

## ViewModel

The ViewModel is responsible for transforming the data receveid in a View representative way and receive the actions from the View

## Layer Separation

The View holds the ViewModel. but the ViewModel do not know anything about the View and the ViewModel Knows about the Model, and the Model do not know about the ViewModel. To send data from the ViewModel to the View, we use combine as a DataBinder to handle those changes.
